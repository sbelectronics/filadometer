# Nixie Tube Filadometer
#### (or is it a Filodometer? I had trouble making up my mind...)

This is a nixie tube filament meter and progress meter, using IN-12 nixie tubes.
Uses a raspberry pi, gets its data from octoprint.

This requires that you install one of my other packages, smb-pi-lib. See https://github.com/sbelectronics/smb-pi-lib. It also requires that you're running my octoprint-prometheus plugin on your octoprint server.

Schematics for the project are up on my blog website at http://www.smbaker.com/
